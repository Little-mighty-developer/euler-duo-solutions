# 🧠 Euler Duo Solutions: DevSecOps Playground

A daily practice repository that transforms Project Euler problem-solving into a comprehensive DevSecOps showcase. Each algorithm solution serves as a gateway to modern software development practices and infrastructure.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to transform simple algorithmic challenges into a full-fledged DevSecOps showcase. Each solution is built in under 15 minutes daily, focusing on both Python and Ruby implementations.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

### Core Development
- **Languages**: Python & Ruby
- **Testing**: 
  - Python: pytest
  - Ruby: RSpec/Minitest
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **API**: RESTful microservices

### DevOps & Security
- **CI/CD**: 
  - GitHub Actions
  - Jenkins
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Security Scanning**:
  - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
  - Docker image scanning
  - Dependency vulnerability audits

## 🚀 Features

- Daily Project Euler problem solutions
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) implementation
- Automated CI/CD pipelines
- Containerized microservices
- Security-first development practices
- Kubernetes deployment configurations

## 🏗️ Architecture

Each solution follows a microservices architecture:
1. Algorithm implementation in Python/Ruby
2. Docker containerization
3. REST API exposure
4. Automated testing
5. Security scanning
6. Kubernetes deployment

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

This project serves as a practical demonstration of:
- Modern software development practices
- DevOps automation
- Security integration
- Container orchestration
- API design
- Test-driven development

## ⏱️ Time Investment

- Daily commitment: 15 minutes
- Focus on incremental improvements
- Emphasis on quality over quantity

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. Select a Project Euler problem
2. Implement solution in Python/Ruby
3. Write comprehensive tests
4. Containerize the solution
5. Expose via REST API
6. Run security scans
7. Deploy to Kubernetes

## 🛡️ Security First

Every solution undergoes:
- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Docker image security checks
- Best practice compliance verification
